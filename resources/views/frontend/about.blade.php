                        <p>I really wanted to be a model when I was little. I loved photography, and I loved being
                            on camera. But I was short and chubby, so I couldn't.
                            Anyway, being an artist is way more interesting than just being a model because it's
                            about you and what you want to be. You're not
                            being treated like a clothes hanger. Light makes photography. Embrace light. Admire it.
                            Love it. But above all, know light. Know it for all you
                            are worth, and you will know the key to photography.</p>
